## Last Requesites
- You can use your Github, GitLab or BitBucket to deliver this test
- Try to keep your commits to a reasonable atomic capacity (We want to be able to understand your line of thinking. Do not be afraid to make really small commits.)
- Use as much best practices you see fit to address the commits and/or branch naming (we use techniques based on gitflow)
- Another PLUS would be to cache some of the API requests ([axios-cache-adapter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios-cache-adapter) is a way to go if you're using Axios)

## Bonus
- Publishing your client in the cloud will be considered a PLUS (Heroko and Netlify are free ways to go)
- Developing tests is optional but will also be considered a PLUS
- Using Service Workers to let your webpage work offline would be very nice
- You can implement some extra features if you want but try not to scape so much from the main goal of the WEB APP

Feel free to ask Patrick Lopes - (**patrick@portaltelemedicina.com.br**) or Luiz Roberto Lethang Rodolpho - (**luiz@portaltelemedicina.com.br**) any question.

You have 7 days counting from tomorrow to finish and deliver us the address of your github repository. Please, let us know if you need more time.

*Thank you for giving us this opportunity to get to know you and your work.*
