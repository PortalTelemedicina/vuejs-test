# Front-end Test for candidate
We expect the candidate to create a Web Page based on the following requisites.

## Technical Requisites

The usage of the following are demanded
- **ES6**
- **Vue.JS CLI** (we use Vue 2.X but fell free to use 3.X with hooks)
- Fell free to use any framework (or none) beside Vue.Js
- Use the [SpaceX API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API/tree/master/docs)
- The WEB APP should be responsive (supporting mobile screens is a PLUS)
- You can use Material Design, Vue Material or a platform such as **Figma** to design your solution (You can choose a different platform if you desire)

### What the Page Should Have
> 1. Show a list of the future Launches
> * Add some details about the launch
> * Date
> * Show if the mission was successful or not
> * Info about the payload if it has one
> * Info about the crew if it has one
> * Allowing the user to search for a launch is a PLUS
> 
> 2. List of the past Launches
> * Add some details about the launch
> * Date
> * Show if the mission was successful or not
> * Info about the payload if it has one
> * Info about the crew if it has one
> * Allowing the user to search for a launch is a PLUS
>

> * You can display some articles or images
> 
> 4. Display the user some Rockets
> * Display some data about the rocket such as: Name, picture, cost per launch and etc
> * Allowing the user to search for a rocket is a PLUS 
> 
All the data above can be acquired using the [SpaceX API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API/blob/master/docs/v4/README.md)

## Running and Executing Requisites
Make your project running with the minimum needed interactions will be considered important in the analysis of your performance.
Make it as easy as possible
The ideal scenario will be to clone your repository and execute it through a single command such as `npm start` or `npm run dev` after doing the `npm install`

## Documentation Requisites
- It can be done in portuguese although being in english will also be considered a plus
- It should be easy to undertand how to execute your tests (if it has any)
- Explain about the page usage and capabilities with some text and images

## Last Requesites
- You can use your Github, GitLab or BitBucket to deliver this test
- Try to keep your commits to a reasonable atomic capacity (We want to be able to understand your line of thinking. Do not be afraid to make really small commits.)
- Use as much best practices you see fit to address the commits and/or branch naming (we use techniques based on gitflow)
- Another PLUS would be to cache some of the API requests ([axios-cache-adapter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios-cache-adapter) is a way to go if you're using Axios)

## Bonus
- Publishing your client in the cloud will be considered a PLUS (Heroko and Netlify are free ways to go)
- Developing tests is optional but will also be considered a PLUS
- Using Service Workers to let your web page work offline would be very nice
- You can implement some extra features if you want, but try to not go away from the main goal of the test

Feel free to ask Patrick Lopes - (**patrick@portaltelemedicina.com.br**) or Luiz Roberto Lethang Rodolpho - (**luiz@portaltelemedicina.com.br**) any question.

You have 7 days counting from tomorrow to finish and deliver us the address of your github repository. Please, let us know if you need more time.

*Thank you for giving us this opportunity to get to know you and your work.*
